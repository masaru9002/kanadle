## 🐱‍👤 Disclaimer

There is no proper backend for this project yet. Everything is carried out on the frontend and local storage. Do whatever you like, though I'd rather you play it properly TvT

I'll set up a proper backend for it soon.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Try to guess the 4-letter Hiragana word
2. After each guess, tiles will show different colors:
   - 🟩 Green: Correct letter in correct spot
   - 🟨 Yellow: Correct letter in wrong spot
   - ⬛ Gray: Letter not in the word
3. You have 12 attempts to guess the word
4. Use the 💡 hint button if you need help with word meanings
